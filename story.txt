There once was a man named Chris P. Bacon. Chris P was being made fun of at school because he had farting issues. He would try to make friends, but everyone would shy away from him because his farts were so gruesome. He did not know the cause of this issue either, so he went on a quest to try and figure out a solution to this problem. On his journey, he realized he wasn't the only one with this issue. He made a friend named Richard Swett.
