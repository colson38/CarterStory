There once was a man named Chris P. Bacon. Chris P was being made fun of at school because he had farting issues. He would try to make friends, but everyone would shy away from him because his farts were so gruesome. He did not know the cause of this issue either, so he went on a quest to try and figure out a solution to this problem. On his journey, he realized he wasn't the only one with this issue. He made a friend named Richard Swett. 

Richard's nickname around school was the "crop duster" since he would pass gas walking around during passing time. Chris and Richard became best buddies; the issue, though, was that every time they would walk together, the farts would intensify to the point where they're borderline lethal. Students were losing consciousness when walking behind them, so they had to fix the farts fast.
