There once was a man named Chris P. Bacon. Chris P was being made fun of at school because he had farting issues. He would try to make friends, but everyone would shy away from him because his farts were so gruesome. He did not know the cause of this issue either, so he went on a quest to try and figure out a solution to this problem. On his journey, he realized he wasn't the only one with this issue. He made a friend named Richard Swett. 

Richard's nickname around school was the "crop duster" since he would pass gas walking around during passing time. Chris and Richard became best buddies; the issue, though, was that every time they would walk together, the farts would intensify to the point where they're borderline lethal. Students were losing consciousness when walking behind them, so they had to fix the farts fast.

They went to the best doctor in town Seymour Butts who had fixed plenty of fart related issues back in his day. But this case was like none he has ever seen, or rather smelled before. He tried every solution in the book, less beans in their diet, banning them from listening to bad fart jokes, but alas nothing worked. Dr. Butts was just about out of ideas until one last resort came to him.

So he forced them to take a lactose intolerant test. Sure enough, both Chris P. and Richard were both lactose intolerant. Dr. Butts encouraged them to take lactaid pills and cut back on the dairy to resolve this issue. This remedy proved to be very helpful, and both Chris P. and Richard did not have a farting issue anymore. They went back to school and made a lot of friends because they were not smelly anymore, and they received better grades in class too. Dr. Butts went on to receive the Nobel peace prize for his efforts.
